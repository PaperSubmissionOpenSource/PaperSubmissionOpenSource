Goals of the workshop
1.	Learn about the design patterns for medical HAI systems.
2.	Re-design a medical HAI system you previously designed.
3.	Reflect on the usage of our design patterns after the design.

The procedure of the workshop
1.	Introduce our design patterns with examples. (20 min)
2.	Ask participants to reflect on the medical HAI systems they have designed before. (10 min)
3.	Ask participants to re-design the mock-up on Miro or Figma for one medical HAI system they have designed before through our design patterns. (30 min)
4.	Ask participants to introduce their mock-up and design rationale and reflect on their usage of our design patterns based on our interview questions. (30 min)
5.	Make participants discuss with peers and draw further conclusions. (25 min)
6.	Collect participantsâ€™ feedback on the usability of our design patterns. (5 min)

Goals of the interview
1.	Evaluate the usability of design patterns: Determine whether our design patterns can assist participants in building their medical HAI systems.
2.	Explore usage strategies: Understand how participants plan to implement the design patterns if they choose to use them.
3.	Identify additional opportunities: Investigate whether there are other possibilities that could benefit participants, to inform our future work.

Questions of the interview
Implementation and usability
1.	Do you think you have refined your system through our design patterns? If so, in what specific aspects?
2.	Can you identify specific design patterns that you found particularly useful during your design process?
3.	What challenges did you encounter in applying these design patterns?
4.	What specific outcomes or improvements do you anticipate as a result of using these design patterns?

Strategy reflection
5.	How did you incorporate these patterns into your design? 
6.	Were there any trade-offs you had to consider?
7.	How do you think these design patterns could be integrated into your future projects?

Future Considerations
8.	Do you have found some new design patterns during your design process?
9.	What dimensions do you think are missing from our current design patterns?
10.	How do you envision the evolution of design patterns for medical HAI systems in the future?
